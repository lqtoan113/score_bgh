## Local setup

Here's how to setup locally.

1. Clone this repo
2. cd go to root directory of project
3. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
4. Copy the `.env.example` file over to your own `.env` file and update the variables

This setup will handle hot reloading, so any updates you make to the NestJS code will update the container in realtime.

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev
